# FdF (wireframe)
The goal of this project was building graphical wireframe model of landscepe.<br>
The map of landscape is passed to the program from file.<br>
Map is composed of two-dimensional array, each item of which represents position, value is height of this position.<br><br>
eg.<br>
0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0<br>
0  0  0  5  5  5  5  5  0<br>
0  0  5  5  8  8  8  5  0<br>
0  0  0  0  5  5  5  5  5<br>
0  0  0  0  5  5  5  5  5<br>
<br>
As usual, the very limited number of atandard functions was allowed. <br>
The custom school minilibX graphics library allows (actually it can manage window image and put picel on that image).
All lines, color gradients etc. should be made by student.

<hr>
Project was made with maximum bunus level for extra functionality as mouse controlled movement and warious rotations, as well as warious color pallettes applied.<br>
<b>Screenshots</b> and onscreen video are shown on project Wiki page as well as in appropriate folder.
